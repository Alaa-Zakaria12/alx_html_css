Web Page Implementation from Scratch
Overview
This project involves creating a fully functional, responsive web page from scratch, without using any external libraries or frameworks. The objective is to replicate a design provided in Figma using pure HTML and CSS, while applying accessibility and responsive design principles. The final web page should look identical to the designer's file and function smoothly across different devices.

Project Features
Pure HTML and CSS: The webpage is built entirely from scratch without the use of libraries or frameworks.
Responsive Design: The layout adjusts seamlessly across various screen sizes, from mobile devices to large desktops.

Accessibility: Ensures that the page is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, adhering to best practices like proper semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.
Design Fidelity: The page closely follows the provided Figma design, ensuring that all visual elements, fonts, and colors match the original design.
Optimized for Performance: Clean and efficient code with proper asset management for fast loading times.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring content using semantic elements.
CSS3: For styling the webpage, including layout, typography, and responsiveness.
Responsive Web Design: Ensuring that the webpage works smoothly across all devices.
Figma: For the design reference.

Accessibility Features
Use of semantic HTML tags (<header>, <nav>, <main>, <footer>) for better structure and screen reader compatibility.
ARIA labels and roles to provide additional context for assistive technologies.
Proper color contrast ratios to improve readability.

Responsive Design Approach
Media Queries: Used to adjust layout and typography for different screen sizes (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop).
Fluid Grids and Flexbox: Employed for a flexible layout that adapts to various screen widths.

Challenges and Learnings
Implementing the design purely with HTML and CSS without using any libraries or frameworks.
Ensuring the page is fully responsive and accessible while maintaining design fidelity.
